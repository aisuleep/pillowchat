# pillowchat
An unofficial web, desktop, and mobile client for Revoltchat made using Flutter &amp; Dart

# Info
I used this project as a way to learn how to code so expect less than ideal code, scuff, and lots of commented out code. However, PRs and bug reports are welcome :)

## Note
So far this client has been tested on Linux Desktop, Web, and Android. Windows, MacOs, and IOS are unconfirmed to work properly yet.
